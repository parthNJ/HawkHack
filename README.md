Lifecard is a solo project which I finished during the Montclair State University's Hackathon. The idea promises to provide an individual's health information to any doctor, physician, and ER specialist with the swipe of their Lifecard. 
Example of a real-world scenario: 
  #Patient is taken or attends a health care organization for a health issue. Either major or minor health issue. 
  
  (For example, consider a scenario where the User is rushed to the hospital due to blood loss from a bad motorcycle accident. 
  #Upon reaching the ER, the physician asks the patient for their blood type and asks for any allergies to medication the patient might have. 
 #The patient has no idea about their blood type or any allergies they might have. Maybe to peanuts they reply. 

The following scenario slows down the process of getting the help an individual need quick as possible. And this issue is not only in hospitals but also in primary care physicians where first-time patients have to fill out 20-30-minute forms and wait in line for others all the time. 

Let’s remove this wait time and introduce Lifecard. Lifecard acts as a credit card that can be swiped at any health care organization and our servers will read the encrypted key on the card and provide the health care physician to view the patient’s health data such as height, weight, allergies, blood type, current medications they are taking, past doctor visits, tests, vaccines they’ve taken and much more. Not only will this help the physicians speed up their patient intake, but this small idea can even save lives where some situations require no time being wasted and knowing the patient’s history is crucial.
